# Why?

The [dash-mpd-rs](https://github.com/emarsden/dash-mpd-rs) library at the core of this application
was developed to allow the author to watch a news programme produced by a public media broadcaster
whilst at the gym. The programme is published as a DASH stream on the broadcaster’s “replay”
service, but network service at the gym is sometimes poor. First world problems!

The author is not the morality police nor a lawyer, but please note that redistributing media
content that you have not produced may, depending on the publication licence, be a breach of
intellectual property laws. Also, circumventing DRM may be prohibited in some countries.
